### 🎮 Mancala Game Solver with Adversarial Search 🤖
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Mancala game, solved using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. Mancala is a traditional African sowing game where the goal is to capture more seeds than your opponent. This project models the game, implements the rules, and uses adversarial search to create an AI opponent.

### 🎯 Objective
-The goal of this project is to:
-Model the Mancala game using Python 🐍.
-Implement the game rules and logic.
-Use the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to create an AI opponent 🤖.
-Allow a human player to play against the AI.

📜 Game Rules
🎲 The game is played on a board with 12 small pits (6 per player) and 2 stores (1 per player).
🌱 Each pit starts with 4 seeds.
🔄 Players take turns picking seeds from one of their pits and sowing them counterclockwise.
🏆 The player with the most seeds in their store at the end of the game wins.
